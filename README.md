### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Welcome to the garbage dump!
There is a lot of hilarious source code scattered around here that doesn't amount to much of anything.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  creating  garbage.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C. But I don't like it.
- ğŸ¤” I want to help the cat.
- ğŸ’¬ If you have a problem, don't ask.
